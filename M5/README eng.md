# 🔐 README – Module 5: Disaster Recovery, Threat Intelligence & Incident Response

## 🔍 Topics Covered

In **Module 5**, we covered key principles of modern security operations, including:

## 🧩 Disaster Recovery Strategies  
Planning and implementing strategies to ensure business continuity during major incidents.

## 🛡️ Threat Intelligence & IOC  
Collecting threat intelligence and analyzing **Indicators of Compromise (IOC)** to detect potential attacks.

## 🚨 Incident Response  
Defining fast and coordinated responses to contain threats such as malware, DDoS, or data breaches.

## 📄 Capstone Project 5: Security Operations Risk Assessment Report

### 📂 Structure:

- 📌 **Security Architecture Risk Mapping**
- 🔍 **Attack Scenarios: SQL Injection, XSS, DDoS, Malware**
- ⚙️ **Proposed Countermeasures: WAF, CSP, NAC, VPC, SIEM**
- 💰 **Business Impact Analysis**
- 🧠 **Zero Trust Approach & Advanced Infrastructure Design**

---

## 🎯 Objective

Simulate security incidents and apply actionable strategies to:

- Prevent and mitigate web attacks (SQLi, XSS)
- Calculate economic impact of a **DDoS** attack
- React to a **malware infection** with fast isolation
- Implement an advanced **Zero Trust** architecture

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Concepts Used

- 🔍 **Nessus, Acunetix, Nikto** – Vulnerability Scanning
- 🔐 **Firewall + WAF** – Layered Defense
- 🧠 **SIEM + SOAR** – Threat Monitoring & Automation
- 🌐 **NAC + VPC + DMZ** – Segmentation and Control
- 🧮 **CVSS Scoring** – Risk Evaluation

---

## ✅ Outcome

- Designed and documented **realistic mitigation plans** for SQLi, XSS, and malware
- Calculated a €15,000 loss for a 10-minute **DDoS** downtime
- Proposed **Zero Trust & AI-based defense enhancements**
- Delivered a comprehensive **Business-Oriented Security Report**

---

## 🧠 Conclusion

This capstone tested both **technical readiness and strategic awareness**. From the detection of IOCs to economic evaluation and advanced defense modeling, it reflects the evolving responsibilities of a modern Cybersecurity Analyst.
