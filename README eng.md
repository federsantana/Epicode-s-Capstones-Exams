👋 Welcome to my Epicode Capstones Exams section!
📁 This repository has been created to showcase my capstone projects for each month I spent in the Cybersecurity Analyst course at Epicode.

🚀 From the first to the last project, I've grown a lot, and I'm continuously working to improve!

💡 Thank you for reading! Feel free to share my work if you find it helpful — I’d be delighted if it supports you in any way with your studies or career.
