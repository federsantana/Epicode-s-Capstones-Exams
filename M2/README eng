# 📘 README – Module 2: Penetration Testing & GameShell

## 🔍 Topics Covered

Module 2 delves into advanced cybersecurity topics with a hands-on approach focused on realistic simulations:

### 1. Advanced Use of Kali Linux
Utilizing the Kali Linux distribution for professional penetration testing, leveraging dedicated tools and virtualized environments for safe, controlled assessments.

### 2. Programming in Python and C for Automation
Developing scripts to automate information gathering, exploitation, process handling, and scanning. Introducing the concept of "attack automation."

### 3. Security Testing of Web Applications
Techniques to detect vulnerabilities in modern web apps: from XSS to SQLi, through practical simulations in vulnerable environments and real-world prototypes.

### 4. Vulnerability Analysis in Linux
Focus on using analysis tools such as `nmap`, `nikto`, `openvas`, and reading system logs. Understanding the Linux OS from both offensive and defensive perspectives.

## 🎮 Capstone Project: GameShell

### What is GameShell?
GameShell is a text-based bash game simulating a fantasy adventure inside a fictional Linux file system. Each directory is a "world" to explore, each Linux command is a spell to master.

> “Learn the shell as if it were a video game: commands, levels, characters, challenges. The terminal becomes your playground.” 

### Educational Goal
To gain mastery of the bash shell through progressive, contextual interaction with essential and advanced Linux commands.

### Setting
The game world is called **World**, a structure that replicates the Linux file system hierarchy:
- `Castle`
- `Mountain`
- `Forest`
- `Garden`
- `Stall`

Each area contains puzzles, files, processes, and scripts to manipulate in order to progress.
